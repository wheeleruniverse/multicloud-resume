However, this project required some technology that I did not want to use on the 'Meta Resume Challenge' project, yet I still wanted to gain experience with the technology behind those requirements. I registered a domain name with Cloud Domains and created a Hosted Zone in Cloud DNS. Deployed a sample Vue application to Cloud Storage that was behind an HTTPS Cloud Load Balancer. The Vue app track visitors using a Python API deployed to Cloud Run that stored data in a Firestore database. The infrastructure was created using Terraform and CI/CD for the frontend and backend code was managed by Cloud Build using a GitOps-style approach that leveraged an 'env' repository. Finally, this sample application merely contained a button that redirected to the 'Meta Resume Challenge' domain. The DNS name that I registered specifically for this challenge will be repurposed.",
